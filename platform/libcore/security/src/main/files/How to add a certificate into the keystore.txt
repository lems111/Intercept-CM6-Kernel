# Only PEM format is allowed to add the certificate in the Android's keystore.
# So, you need to convert other format like DER binary format to PEM format.
# Simply use the export tool inside certifiate.
# Also, we need to check the path of keytool in the host pc. Be sure to use keytool from JDK 1.6.x.
# put the certificates with PEM format into cacerts folder.
# run certimport.sh 
# If you want to see the certificate list from the keystore, run certdisplay.sh 
# 
# Caution: Market application doesn't work if the wrong certificate is inserted into the keystore. 
# It is required to check Google's Market application as well as the secure site.
